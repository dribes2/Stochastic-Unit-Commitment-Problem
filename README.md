This repository has the goal of sharing and recreating the results from the paper "XXXXXXX" written by David Ribes and Tatiana Grandon. For extra info, send an email to david.r.marza@ntnu.no.

The paper solves two different problems: Stochastic Unit Commitment Problem and Deterministic Unit Commitment Problem, both of them solved in the folders Stoch_UCP and Det_UCP respectively.

Since D-Wave requires a non-free access token, the results of D-Wave runs are provided in the results files. They are compressed in zip files due to storage reasons.

This problem instance is shown in two main plots:
- cost_vs_reliability: dependence of the cost function value on the reliability level p = 1 - \epsilon. This is obtained for three different covariance matrices in the sampleset of scenarios: Non-correlated, Moderately correlated and Highly Correlated.

- cost_vs_scenarios: dependence of the cost function value on the amount of scenarios considered in the sampleset.
